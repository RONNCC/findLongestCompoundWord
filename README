FindLongest Program - Shomiron Ghose

=======
Summary
=======
Uses a trie and a set of lengths to find the k longest
'compound' words, words that can be formed from other words,
efficiently. 


=============
Compatability
=============
Does not use C++11 extensions as they are not all fully implemented
across compilers

=====
Usage
=====

Run `make` and then `./findLongest` to run it and output results for
wordsforproblem.txt. 

to:
    - make the file: `make`
    - delete generated files: `make clean`
    - verify memory is completely freed, (depends on valgrind)
        run: `make checkmem`
    - profile the program: `make profile` (depends on gprof)
    - run and time the program: `make time` (depends on time.py)

====
Help
====

running ./findCommand gives usage information for it
python time.py -h gives usage help for time.py

Unfortunately as expected  we find some of the most time consuming operations
are the string parsing ones :(. With preprocessing time and further
assumptions, we can speed up the actual computation time significantly
more, in addition we can consider the use of vector operations to reduce
the number of trie nodes created and increase thoroughput. 

In addition, our malloc/free is taking up quite a bit of time, using a 
thread-safe free and depending on our use case, we could use a parallel
implementation of freeing the trie.
